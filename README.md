# Lira Protocol

**Lira Protocol** is a modular, event-driven automation layer built on **Solana**, designed to enable secure, private, and intelligent execution of onchain workflows.

With **Super-Transactions**, smart wallets, and a no-code automation copilot, Lira empowers developers and autonomous systems to automate complex operations with minimal effort — all while keeping full control of assets and logic.
