Lira Protocol
The modular, event-driven automation layer for Solana and beyond.

:: Overview
Lira Protocol brings intelligent, private, and composable automation to Web3.

With intent-based Super-Transactions and an event-driven execution engine, Lira enables onchain processes to run autonomously — triggered by real-world conditions, user-defined logic, or scheduled events.

Built for developers, DAOs, and autonomous agents, Lira is the infrastructure layer that transforms smart contract automation from a fragmented task into a seamless, verifiable experience.

:: Core Capabilities
✅ Event-driven Super-Transactions

✅ Private, MEV-resistant execution

✅ No-code automation Copilot

✅ Smart wallet integration

✅ Composable multi-step logic

✅ Onchain workflows with real-world triggers

From DeFi to RWA, Lira automates what others still code manually.

:: Core Modules
Automation Copilot
AI-powered, natural language automation builder.
Users describe their intent — Lira compiles the logic.

Event Registry & Execution Engine
Continuously listens for triggers like time, price, or smart contract state.
Executes workflows autonomously and concurrently.

Smart Wallet Abstraction
Bundles actions securely through account abstraction.
No private keys exposed. No custody required.

Super-Transactions
Intent-based, multi-step workflows bundled into a single, composable operation — from swaps to payments to contract calls.

:: Technical Stack
Solana – Execution layer

TypeScript / Rust – Protocol modules and tooling

Smart Wallet Standard – Based on modular ERC-6900-like design for Solana

MEV Protection – Native privacy and integrity built in

Future Modules – Oracle integrations, intent relays, DAO-triggered automation

:: Status
Lira is in active development.
Core protocol logic is being finalized for DevNet.
SDKs, test interfaces, and full public repo coming soon.

:: Vision
Automation should be secure, intuitive, and decentralized.
Lira aims to be the trusted foundation for onchain execution — powering everything from yield optimization and trading logic to governance, payments, and autonomous agents.

Web3 won’t scale without automation.
Lira makes that automation seamless.
